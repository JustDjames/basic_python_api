# Basic Python Api

This is a basic Api written in Python. It performs CRUD (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) on a list of users.

## Installation

### Requirements
* Python (2 or 3 is fine)
* pip for your version of python
* a live-server to run the webpage, such as [Node.js live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) ( I use [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on VS Code)

### Setup
1) Once you have cloned this repo, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt ``` in the directory ( you may need to use pip3 if you have both versions of python installed )

## Usage

1) To run enter ```python api.py``` ( you may need to use python3 if you have both versions of python installed )

2) Start your live-server in the webpage directory in this repo

3) follow the instructions on the webpage to make calls to the api

4) you can also use a rest client like [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) ( or just use curl )
